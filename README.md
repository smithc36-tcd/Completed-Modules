### - MEU11E11 Experimental Methods
The ability to conduct accurate and repeatable measurements from reliable sensors
is an essential task of the professional engineer. The proliferation of sensors both
physical and virtual has revolutionised engineering design workflows through Data
Centric Engineering design ideas. The aim of this module is to provide exposure to
the concepts and processes of modern engineering measurement and experimental
techniques now expressed through the Data Centric Engineering workflow. The
module prepares students for conducting their first experiments in engineering and
exploiting the data gathered with modern toolsets. Students will study the role of
error and uncertainty in measurement and data analysis, the operating principles of
commonly used measurement devices and the principles of data conversion
including analog to digital converters and digital to analog converters. This will
equip students to prepare and conduct experiments and enable them to complete
a real world data acquisition and analysis task before completion of the module
