### EEU22E06 Electronics
Up to this point, students will have learned simple yet powerful techniques to
analyse basic circuits. The term 'basic' is used here to denote circuits that
consist of only ideal power sources i.e. voltage and current sources, and ideal
linear resistors. Such circuits are completely described by linear algebraic
equations. Therefore, all voltages and currents in the circuit are scaled replicas
of the input signal; if the input is doubled, all other voltages and currents are
likewise doubled. Such circuits are of limited practical use.
This module introduces dynamic elements, namely the capacitor and inductor.
These elements have the ability to change the shape of the input waveform,
providing for more complicated outputs and hence more useful functionalities.
For example, energy storage is now possible, as are oscillations - a fundamental
requirement for circuits that are used in wireless data transmission.
Frequency response is introduced - a very important concept that shows how
circuits can be used to filter out unwanted signals, leaving only the signal of
interest (consider the task of filtering out the thousands of unwanted phone
conversations from the myriad of signals transmitted across the airwaves,
leaving only the desired conversation signal).
Nonlinear components add even more types of behaviour allowing
applications such as ac to dc conversion. Unfortunately, the powerful analysis
methods of linear algebra are no longer applicable - methods to deal with this
issue are introduced.
The important task of amplification - to ensure those aforementioned phone
conversations can reach their destination - is also introduced.

### EEU33E03 3E3 Probability and Statistics 
The primary objective of 3E3 is to provide a secure and accessible
grounding for all sophister engineering students in probability and
statistics. The module equips them with consistent methods for
reasoning amid the uncertainties they encounter in their professional
practice. In this way, the module supports decision-making in the
uncertain contexts of real engineering practice.

The most important context in which engineers cope with uncertainty is
when they gather and process information-bearing data, and use them
to plan future actions. Therefore, statistical design is the main extended
context for the application of probability methods in this module. Being
a module for all sophister engineers, examples are drawn liberally from
their universal human experience (games of chance, social analyses,
COVID-19 statistics, etc.), but also from accessible contexts in
engineering, notably vehicular traffic phenomena, reliability and
lifetime of devices, causal inference in bioengineering, low-count and
high-count sensor outputs in imaging systems, quantization and
observation noise, and telecommunications.

The keystone of the module is a philosophical one. The fundamental
relationship between uncertainty and information (learning) is explored
from the start. An initial review of propositional logic is provided, being
a familiar context for the engineer, so that the student can be confident
in formulating propositions associated with an uncertain experiment,
and in understanding logical relationships between propositions
(sufficiency, necessity, equivalence). The probability calculus is then
developed as a consistent means of quantifying and manipulating the
engineer’s beliefs in these uncertain propositions (i.e. the Bayesian
perspective), opening a path beyond merely logical relationships. In this
way, the foundation of the module is a unitary one, with such notions as
logic, uncertainty, information, observation (data) and imprecision
(noise) all embraced within a Bayesian notion of probability.

The module explores engineering contexts that induce the canonical
probability models, in both the discrete case (Bernoulli, geometric,
binomial, multinomial, Poisson) and the continuous case (uniform,
exponential, m-Erlang, Gaussian). Their mixtures and transformations
are developed as a response to practical modelling needs. There is a
special emphasis on the concept of dependence (conditioning), and its
relationship to the key notions of correlation, association, causation and
prediction. In this context, probability graphs are introduced for systems
of discrete dependent phenomena, and key inferences are computed.
Markov chains are introduced as a key, tractable, and widely applicable
relaxation into dependence. A main learning outcome for the student is
the ability to choose the appropriate probability model to apply in a range
of engineering contexts, such as those listed above, guided by an
understanding of the assumptions that justify the deployment of each
model.

A feature of the module is that it develops statistics consistently, using
the same inductive inference principles described above. Often a blind
spot in the formation of the engineering student, statistical inference is
correctly re-cast in this module as an application of probability
modelling, with the consistent statistical transformation being
prescribed by the chosen model. In this way, the student gains the skill
to design data transformations, dispensing with the traditional cookbook of statistical recipes which has little appeal to engineers with
design interests. The simple nonparametric case is emphasized, using
the elegant device of the empirical distribution. This allows students to
derive appropriate descriptive statistics for their data, to estimate
probabilities, and to describe association and regression phenomena
quantitatively. An accessible introduction to parametric estimation is
also provided, via moment matching techniques, and linear regression is
developed via estimation of the bivariate Gaussian parameters. Finally,
some of the standard statistical hypothesis tests are motivated and
applied. Together, these topics introduce the engineer to the culture,
nomenclature and practice of statistics as commonly encountered in
engineering practice.

The module is an invitation to the student to confront uncertainty as a
fundamental phenomenon – and resource – in engineering systems, to
appreciate probability as a consistent framework for the design,
analysis and optimization of such systems, and to explore and exploit
data in a principled way.
